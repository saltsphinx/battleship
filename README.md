Battleship, a game where you and your opponent take turns launching attacks against one anothers fleet of battle ships. Play against a fairy simple AI and see if you can win. This project was originally intented to test out the TDD(Test Driven Development) development process, but I gave the project a break about half through. I wanted to see how well I could do returning to old code I hadn't looked over in awhile, and decided to pick the project back up.

A few features missing:
- The ability for the player to place their ships
- Enforced spacing between the ships
- More intelligent AI that attacks in surrounding location of successful attack
